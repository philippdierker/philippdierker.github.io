# Philipp Dierker
_Postdoctoral Researcher in Social Demography_

Philipp Dierker studies how family and partnership dynamics relate to mental and physical health across the life course. His work combines longitudinal survey and population register data with genetic information and panel-data methods to separate selection from causal change.

**Research areas**
- Social demography; family and health
- Partnership formation, dissolution, and re-partnering
- Mental health and well-being across transitions
- Gene–environment interplay (sociogenomics)
- Longitudinal methods (fixed effects; dynamic DiD)

**Current projects**
- Family complexity and midlife health  
- Mental health around partnership transitions  
- Parents’ separation, re-partnering, and children’s mental health  
- Open, reproducible code for published articles

**Methods & data**
Fixed-effects and dynamic difference-in-differences; sibling/twin fixed effects; integration of polygenic indices; multi-wave panel surveys and population registers.
