_Postdoctoral Researcher in Social Demography_

I recently received my PhD in Demography from the University of Helsinki. Currently, I work as a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Social Demography at the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research. I study how family dynamics relate to mental and physical health across the life course. My work combines longitudinal survey and population register data with genetic information and panel-data methods.

**Research areas**
- Social demography; family and health
- Partnership formation, dissolution, and re-partnering
- Mental health and well-being across transitions
- Gene–environment interplay (sociogenomics)
- Longitudinal methods (fixed effects; dynamic DiD)
